            Blaze started tattooing in 2009 when he got his first machine as a gift, and the rest is history. Blaze has done countless tattoos, ranging from cute and dainty hearts to large chest and back pieces, but his favorite style is cartoons. The attention to detail that Blaze has helps him to continue to sharpen his skill with the ink and needle. He practices with new techniques and equipment to ensure the best possible outcome for his clients. Like a true artist, Blaze takes his time to understand his canvas and the art that is going on it.</p>
